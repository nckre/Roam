# Minimal Sidebar
Roam Customization with JS and CSS to minimize the sidebar. It works best with "Full" Layout so that the text of a page is close to the sidebar.

## JS
* Hides text next to 4 top items (Graph Name, Daily Notes, Graph Overview, All Pages)
* Changes "TODO" to a emoji checkbox
* Changes starred pages to emojis


## CSS
* Changes the color and size of the sidebar
* Hides the expander to expand/collapse sidebar 
* Hides the roam logo at the bottom of the bar
* Hides the start and "Shortcut" text

## Make these changes
The starred pages are referred to by the respective block reference, will need to exchange these for own starred pages and chose fitting emojis or letters (whatever fits the size).


## Known issues
- It's not optimised for mobile, for mobile the expander that's hidden with CSS would be useful. Clicking on "Todo" hides the bar for me.
